# Non Markovian dynamics
These codes were written during 2009-2014 and were applied to describe the ultrafast dynamics of a laser driven exciton system interacting with a photon reservoir [label]<https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.201305>.
It simulates the dynamics by via a time-local numerical scheme while treating the shaped laser pulse exactly.
